<br>

1. Project Overview

This project analyzes the performance of a marketing campaign to identify key customer segments and optimize future promotional strategies. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior, offer engagement, and overall campaign effectiveness.

2. Data Sources

The analysis was performed on a dataset of over 272,000 rows, created by merging three separate data sources:

events.csv: Customer actions, including transactions and offer interactions.

offers.csv: Metadata for each offer, such as type, difficulty, and duration.

customers.csv: Demographic data for each customer, including age, gender, and income.

3. Key Findings & Visualizations

The analysis yielded several key insights, which are summarized below with supporting visualizations.

Finding 1: Discount Offers Outperformed BOGO

Discount offers had a higher completion rate than BOGO (Buy One Get One) offers. This suggests that customers found discount offers more appealing or easier to complete.

Finding 2: The Most Active Customer Segments

Customers aged 30–44 with an income between €50K–€100K were the most active group, completing the highest number of offers. This segment represents a high-value target for future campaigns.

Finding 3: Engagement Peaked Mid-Campaign

Engagement built gradually and peaked between Day 15 and Day 24. This 9-day window saw the highest number of offer completions, after which engagement dropped sharply.

4. Actionable Recommendations

Based on the findings, here are several recommendations for improving future campaigns:

Target the right customer segments: Prioritize the 30–44 age group with incomes of €50K–€100K.

Focus on high-performing offers: Make discount offers the primary promotion in future campaigns.

Optimize campaign timing: Schedule reminders between Day 15–24 to boost engagement.

Enhance personalization: Customize messaging where possible by gender and income.
